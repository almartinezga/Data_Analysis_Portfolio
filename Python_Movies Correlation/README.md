# Python Movies correlation

# 1. Aims, objectives and background

## 1.1 Description
Diving into the captivating world of cinema, this project seeks to unravel the factors that lead to a movie's financial success. Fueled by the hypothesis that a movie's budget plays a pivotal role, I embarked on a data-driven journey to uncover the correlations between various variables and movie revenue.

## 1.2 Aims and objective
The main question this project aims to answer is: What are the factors that lead to a movie's financial success? Budget? Votes? Score? The year of release?

## 1.3 Methodology
Armed with the hypothesis that a movie's budget holds the highest correlation with its revenue, I embarked on a journey to validate or deny this assumption. The steps followed were:
1. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle[[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies), I constructed the DataFrame to serve as the foundation of my analysis.
2. Data cleaning and processing to ensure data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and visual representation of the interplay between variables.
4. Sharing findings in the presentation attached to the repository.

## 1.4 Impact and contribution
In an industry where creativity and commerce intersect, understanding the factors driving a movie's success is not only intellectually stimulating but also holds practical implications for filmmakers and studios.

Also, the project serves as a stepping stone for further analysis. A pending regression analysis, which I plan on doing, aims to answer the pivotal question: "How much should you invest in a movie to ensure its success at the box office?".

## 1.5 Limitations
The dataset I used for the project is publicly available in Kaggle [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). Since the data was downloaded from Kaggle, it relies on the quality and accuracy of the source from which it was originally compiled. Additionally, it was last updated in 2020, which means it may not include movies released in the latest years (post-2020). This limitation could affect the analysis of recent trends in the film industry.

## 1.6 Acknowledgements
I extend my gratitude to 'Alex the Analyst' for his invaluable guidance, which served as a cornerstone for this project. I drew inspiration from his video titled 'Data Analyst Portfolio Project | Correlation in Python | Project 4/4'[[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPYVYBtUTyE&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=4&t=2763s&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst). I used his code as a foundation for my Data Analysis project. However, I have made considerable modifications and enhancements to tailor the analysis to my specific goals and requirements. While the initial code provided valuable insights, I have adapted it to suit the unique aspects of my project and make it my own.

Additionally, credit is duly attributed to the dataset's creator, Daniel Grijalva, which can be accessed on Kaggle [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
