# Data_Analysis_Portfolio
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my data analysis portfolio, where I combine my knowledge and interests with my passion for data analytics!

ðŸ“Š I invite you to journey through three compelling projects that showcase my expertise in extracting insights from complex datasets. I have meticulously crafted each project to demonstrate my proficiency in data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

**[Project 1: YouTube Analytics](https://github.com/almartinezga/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Python_YouTube%20API/Aims%2C%20objectives%20and%20background.md)**

ðŸŒ® In a digital landscape dominated by content creators, I harnessed the YouTube API to uncover the secrets behind the success of the most-subscribed food and drink YouTube channels in Mexico. I dissect user engagement, video duration, titles, tags, and upload timings to reveal strategies that resonate with Mexican audiences.
- Software: Python (Libraries: YouTube API, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, nklt).

**[Project 2: Movie Correlation Analysis]()**

ðŸŽ¥ The world of cinema is a captivating blend of creativity and business. In my movie correlation analysis project, I navigated a vast dataset to discern the factors that drive a movie's revenue. By employing data processing, exploratory data analysis, and correlation matrices, I unveiled the intricate relationships between variables, ultimately shedding light on the path to box office success.
- Software: Python (Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).

**[Project 3: COVID-19 Exploration]()**

ðŸ¦  In the midst of a global pandemic that reshaped our world, my COVID-19 exploratory data analysis project delves deep into infection and vaccination rates across the globe. Through a myriad of SQL techniques, I unearthed vital trends and patterns, providing insights into the pandemic's evolution. This project is a testament to my analytical rigor and ability to decipher critical data.
- Software: SQL (Skills: Joins, Temporary Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views).

ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for considering my portfolio, and I look forward to discussing how my data analysis expertise can contribute to your organization's success.
